hi!

Here are the commands I used in order to do the following from the cmd:

1. Creating a bucket: aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <nameofbucket>
2. Creating a key: aws km create-key --description "..." --key-usage ENCRYPT_DECRYPT ...

N.B you can modify in the "KeySpec" and "EncryptionAlgorithm" fields ONLY
