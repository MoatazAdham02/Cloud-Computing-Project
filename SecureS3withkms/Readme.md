Hi Everyone!

I'll explain the steps to create a symmetric key using kms(Key Management System)

1. Search kms in the search bar and choose Customer Managemet key
2. Create key, choose symmetric
3. give your key an alias name to avoid confusion
4. search for your name in steps 3 and 4 where you'll be given access to this key
5. create the key
6. create a bucket
7. go to "Default Encryption" section and choose"SSE-KMS"
8. select "Choose from your AWS KMS keys" and choose the key you created

N.B you can find the key in the properties tab.
